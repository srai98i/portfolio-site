            I have always found tech exciting but I never saw myself having the
            talent to build the seemingly magical software I enjoyed using.
            After playing around with basic HTML and CSS one day, I was amazed
            with how I was able to make my computer say "Hello World!". I had to
            research more into the tech world and found that in this
            ever-evolving industry, the learning opportunities and challenges
            are endless. A career as a software developer seemed incredibly
            exciting, so I gathered the confidence to join the School of Code.
            16 weeks later, I'm now a Junior Software Developer!

            I use my analytical, problem solving and teamworking skills to build
            software with other equally passionate developers. I am interested
            in both front-end and back-end development and am always looking to
            push myself to work with more technologies and languages!
