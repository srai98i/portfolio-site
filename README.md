## Challenges and Lessons

### Getting Started
 Building a site from scratch is overwhelming as I did not know where to start. 

 After looking at many portfolios of other software developers, I knew the main components I needed on my site. 

 I made a high fidelity wireframe on Figma to reflect what I wanted my site to look like.
 
 With the layout and components of the site decided, I chose to follow a YouTube tutorial to build the skeleton of my site.

 This was helpful because:
 - Following along allowed me to learn the process of how to build a site from scratch
 - I had only built one [project](https://github.com/srai98i/personality-quiz.git) with Next JS and CSS Tailwind before starting this project, so following along with the tutorial helped me learn a lot about both technologies.
 - The tutorial taught me how to make a site responsive using CSS Tailwind, something I struggled with in the previous [Personality Quiz](https://github.com/srai98i/personality-quiz.git) project.

 ### Colour Scheme

 The colour scheme of this website was important because I wanted the site to look good as well as being accessible. 
 
 My initial colour scheme (background: #DB5375 + #2F97C1, text: #EEF4ED) did not score well on the [Coolors Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/). The score was Very Poor.

 I had to rework my wireframes and went with #000000 as my background colour and #EA9EB1 + #ffffff as my text colours. This colour scheme had a score of Very Good.
 
 ### What I've Learnt

 - This project has been very helpful as I've become more confident with building a site using Next JS and CSS Tailwind.

 - I have a better understanding of pages and components in Next JS.

 - I have learnt how make a site responsive with CSS Tailwind properties.

 - I can fix errors with deployment with confidence.

 - Because of this project, I want to learn more about accessibility and basic UI to make better decisions with styling.

 - I have followed agile principles during this project, regularly reworking wireframes and initial plans when problems arise.
